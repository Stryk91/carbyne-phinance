## MSFT EARNINGS DEEP DIVE

### Why This Matters (Even Though We Don't Hold MSFT)
1. **Sector bellwether** - MSFT cloud/AI results impact NVDA, AMZN
2. **AI spending indicator** - Azure CapEx signals for chip demand
3. **Market sentiment** - Big tech results drive overall market direction

### Bull Case for MSFT
- 9 consecutive quarters of beats
- Azure cloud growth strong (AI data centers in Atlanta, Wisconsin)
- Revenue growth accelerating (15.3% vs 12.3% prior year)

### Bear Case for MSFT
- CapEx surge 60% YoY ($36.25B) - margin pressure
- Valuation multiples compressed across software sector
- UBS lowered PT to $600 from $650

### Potential NVDA Impact
- POSITIVE: Strong Azure CapEx = more GPU demand
- NEGATIVE: Soft guidance could signal AI spending peak
- NEUTRAL: Priced in expectations already high

## TRADING CONSIDERATIONS

### For Today's Session
1. **MSFT Earnings Risk** - After close, could move tech sector
2. **Fed Decision** - Expected hold, look for hawkish/dovish language
3. **TSLA Earnings** - We hold 59 shares, binary event risk

### Debate Topics
1. Should we reduce TSLA pre-earnings?
2. Should we buy the AAPL/AMZN dip?
3. Is the NVDA trim still warranted after bounce?
4. Should we add MSFT post-earnings if results strong?
5. Cash reserve: how to address 0.1% violation?
