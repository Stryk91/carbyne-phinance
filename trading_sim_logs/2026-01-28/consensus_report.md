### CONSENSUS MATRIX

| Decision Point | BULL Position | BEAR Position | FINAL CONSENSUS |
|----------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| NVDA 325 Trim | CANCEL | EXECUTE | **EXECUTE REDUCED (200 shares)** |
| AAPL 50 Trim | CANCEL + BUY | EXECUTE | **EXECUTE** |
| TSLA Holdings | HOLD | REDUCE | **HOLD (small position)** |
| BTC Position | ADD 0.5 | REDUCE | **HOLD** |
| BNB Position | TRIM 5% | TRIM to 15% | **HOLD** |
| Cash Target | Accept violation | 5% minimum | **BUILD TO 3%** |

---

## RATIONALE FOR DECISIONS

### 1. NVDA: TRIM 200 SHARES (Compromise)

**Why 200 instead of 325 or 0:**
- BULL correctly notes AI tailwinds and NVDA's bounce
- BEAR correctly notes concentration risk at 41%
- Compromise: Trim 200 shares to bring allocation to ~35%
- This addresses violation partially while preserving upside
- Sets stop-loss at $185 on remaining position

**Order:**
- Action: SELL
- Ticker: NVDA
- Quantity: 200 shares
- Type: MARKET at open
- Stop-loss: $185 (trailing)
- Estimated proceeds: ~$38,386

### 2. AAPL: EXECUTE 50-SHARE TRIM

**Why proceed with trim:**
- BOTH models agree on earnings risk (Thu after close)
- BEAR's concern about China demand weakness valid
- Current -3.4% weakness suggests market uncertainty
- Pre-earnings trim is prudent risk management

**Order:**
- Action: SELL
- Ticker: AAPL
- Quantity: 50 shares
- Type: MARKET at open
- Estimated proceeds: ~$12,340

### 3. TSLA: HOLD 59 SHARES

**Why hold despite earnings tonight:**
- Position size only 2.4% - manageable binary risk
- TSLA showing strength (+3.09%) into earnings
- Asymmetric risk/reward at small size
- Cost basis likely favorable

**No Order - HOLD**

### 4. BTC: HOLD CURRENT POSITION

**Why neither add nor reduce:**
- BULL's contrarian case has merit but timing uncertain
- BEAR's "deeper correction" warning valid
- Current 17.7% allocation acceptable
- Wait for stability above $90k before any action

**No Order - HOLD**

### 5. BNB: HOLD CURRENT POSITION

**Why not trim:**
- Neither model presented compelling immediate catalyst
- Stablecoin/exchange utility provides floor
- No urgent need given other sources of cash
- Monitor alongside BTC

**No Order - HOLD**

### 6. AMZN: HOLD CURRENT POSITION

**Why not buy the dip (BULL suggestion):**
- No cash available until trims execute
- -3.98% drop could indicate more weakness
- Wait for MSFT earnings signal
- Revisit post-earnings week

**No Order - HOLD**

|----------|-----------|----------|-------|

| AAPL | $240.00 | -2.8% | After trim, on remaining |

## MSFT EARNINGS MONITORING PROTOCOL

Since we hold no direct MSFT position, monitor for:

1. **Strong Beat (>$4.00 EPS)**: Consider adding AAPL/AMZN Thursday
2. **In-Line ($3.90-3.95 EPS)**: Maintain current positions
3. **Miss (<$3.85 EPS)**: Tighten stops on all tech positions

Post-earnings action window: Thursday AM if results favorable.

---

## TSLA EARNINGS PROTOCOL (Tonight)

We hold 59 shares (2.4% allocation):

1. **Strong Beat**: No action needed, let winners run
2. **Miss**: Evaluate stop at $400 next session
3. **Guidance Cut**: Trim 30 shares if gap down >10%

---

## FLAGS FOR HUMAN REVIEW

1. **NVDA still above 33% limit** - Partial compliance only
2. **Earnings week volatility** - Multiple binary events
3. **BTC at critical support** - Watch $84,500 level
4. **Fed decision today** - Unlikely to move markets but monitor

## CONFIDENCE LEVEL

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Bull-Bear Agreement | 60% |
| Risk Mitigation | HIGH |
| Execution Clarity | HIGH |
| Overall Confidence | MEDIUM-HIGH |
